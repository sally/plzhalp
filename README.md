## The Problem

Students at DBC have trouble scheduling office hours with teachers to cover specific topics. Office hours are either fully booked or students are unable to find 1 on 1 time with a mentor.

## The Solution

PlzHalp is an easy to use calendar tool that allows teachers to create appointments at specific times. It uses profile data to help students select the appropriate mentor for their needs.
